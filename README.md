**Predictive Analysis for Campus Safety: Modeling Burglary Risk at Atlanta’s Major Universities**

## Abstract 
*Abridged Version*

Abstract: Routine Activity Theory teaches that “Crime requires a motivated offender, a suitable
target, and the opportunity”. Per the 2024 U.S Census, the Atlanta Metropolitan area is the 8th
largest Metropolitan area in the United States. Students deciding to attend university in large
metro areas must consider the local crime rate near the university. This project focuses on
analyzing burglaries and burglary related crime in areas around major college campuses in
Atlanta, with the goal of forecasting risk levels and hotspots that are safety concerns for
students. This study will center around 4 major campuses, Georgia State University, Georgia
Tech, Clark Atlanta University, and Spelman College. We will utilize the Atlanta Police
Department’s (APD) Open Data Portal to access offense type and the time and coordinates of
each offense. To ensure specificity and relevance, we will use spatial filters to only include
incidents that occur within a 1-mile radius of each campus, where we predict that students will
be disproportionately impacted.


## 🧑‍🚀 Team

We are an student research team bringing together our technical expertise to build models aimed at reduucing burglary risk near Metro Atlanta college campuses.
